## Iteration Velocity Widget 

Please build a Rally Custom html widget to show velocity for user stories and defects assigned to an iteration.  
The widget should be a column chart.  
The items should be aggregated by Iteration and stacked by whether or not they were accepted within the Iteration based on their AcceptedDate
There should be an option to show Count or Sum of Plan Estimate on the Y axis.
There should be another option for the number of iterations to display.  The number should default to 6. 
If the item was Accepted before the EndDate of the Iteration it is assigned to, then the color should be Green.  
If the item was Accepted after the EndDate of the Iteration the item should be Light Green.  
If the item is assigned to the iteration and not yet accepted, it should be Red.
